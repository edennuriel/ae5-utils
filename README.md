# Some usefull bash utils to work with anaconda enterprise 5

- To get started you need to clone the repository
- Optionally copy everything to ~/scripts, or set BASEDIR to the current folder (one above scripts)
- If you want to store user/pass for AE5 in a file, cp env.sh.example scripts/env.sh and edit it with the user/pass 
- This is rough set of functions/scripts that I use, I never intended for this to be used by others to expect things to break.
- cd scripts && source ae5_utils.sh # you have to cd scripts or it will not work!
- ae5_utils -h # to list some of the sourced functions, you can also edit the file and see what functions are there.
